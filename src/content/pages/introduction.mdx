# Mystic UI

<Text textStyle="xl">Collection of beautiful UI components for SolidJS that work with Tailwind and PandaCSS.</Text>

## Why?

I think by now we all know how important a good UI is for websites and applications. It's the first thing users see and it's the first thing they interact with, so it's important to get it right.

Inspite of that, I would rather focus on buiding the *heart* of the software, I guess that's why component libraries such as [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [Park UI](https://park-ui.com/) are so popular, they allow developers to focus on the core of their software while resting assured in the fact that users will have a good first impression.

That's why I made **Mystic UI**, because currently there is no collection of *cool and beautiful components* for the SolidJS ecosystem, and I think it's important to have one.
